# BioGen_Translator-CODE
The program takes a DNA sequence typed by user only in the form of A,T,G,C and converts it into a protein sequence using the genetic code.
This Java project converts a DNA sequence into a protein sequence based on the genetic codon table. The program accepts a DNA string as input from user, validates it, groups it into codons (three bases each), and translates each codon into its corresponding amino acid. It identifies the start codon (ATG) and stops translation when a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) is reached. The output reuslt the final protein sequence using standard one-letter amino acid codes.
How its work :- 
1. Computer ask for enter the DNA sequence.
2. Enter the DNA sequence in the form of A,T,C,G only.
3. After entering the sequence write END.
4. Your output show.
 
Applications are follows
* Protein sequence prediction
* Gene expression studies
* Molecular biology research
* Bioinformatics education and tools
